            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Samah, a web developer with over 6 years of experience, mainly working with Ruby on Rails.
                Between 2014 and 2021, I was actively involved in building and maintaining web applications for various
                clients and companies. I focused on backend development, database design, and creating clean, scalable
                APIs — all while following best practices like test-driven development and Agile workflows.</p>

            <p>Since 2021, I’ve taken a break from full-time work. During this time, I’ve stayed connected to tech by
                self-studying, experimenting with small projects, and now, through a structured training program that
                includes a full revision of Ruby on Rails along with front-end fundamentals like HTML and CSS.</p>

            <p>This training is helping me refresh my Rails knowledge — from MVC architecture and routing to
                ActiveRecord and deployment — while also improving my understanding of clean UI design with HTML and
                CSS. I'm using this opportunity to rebuild my portfolio and prepare to re-enter the job market stronger
                and more up to date with the current Rails ecosystem.</p>

            <p>I'm passionate about writing clean code, solving real-world problems, and continuing to grow as a
                developer.</p>
